title: A Quick Guide on GBA Flashcarts
---

Here are the best GBA flashcarts available on the market currently. For other consoles, please see the [quick start guide list](index.html).

The below flashcarts are purchasable from AliExpress or reputable retro accessory stores like [Hand Held Legend](https://handheldlegend.com) and [Retro Game Repair Shop](https://retrogamerepairshop.com).

## Recommended carts
### Everdrive X5 (Mini)
Premium option with the best battery life, often touted as the best option in general. Original version protrudes a bit out of the console. Mini version fits snug like a regular cartridge. Either costs $100 USD.

### EZ Flash Omega Definitive Edition
Premium option with better battery life and some niche features like rumble and Slot-2 DS compatibility for linking. Fixes save issue from regular version. Has a bigger pcb so it doesnt come with the alternative DS Lite shell. Costs $80-100 USD. [Mahko made a more indepth post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/kv9y87/after_playing_with_the_new_ezflash_omega/).

### EZ Flash Omega
The non-premium option with a few shortcomings. It has a notable battery drain and requires waiting 5-10 seconds for it to write saves onto the sd card. Also comes with an alternate shell to sit flush in the DS Lite. Costs $40-50 USD.

### SuperCard SD
The cheapest and worst option. It requires a custom rom patcher specific for this cart that reportedly doesn't work on newer windows versions. Only supports 2GB SD cards. However, it seems to be the only readily available cart to work in conjunction with TWiLight Menu++ on DS Phat/Lite for loading GBA games natively on those systems via Slot-1. Costs anywhere between $10-20 USD.
