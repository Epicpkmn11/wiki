title: Famicom Disk System Flashcarts
---

Famicom Disk System (FDS) flashcarts do not exist. However, not all hope is lost. Most known NES and Famicom flashcarts will play FDS titles with no modification. Please keep in mind [NTSC-vs-PAL considerations](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/ntsc-vs-pal-flashcart-considerations), as the Famicom Disk System was NTSC-J, only. See [Famicom Flashcarts](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/famicom-flashcarts) and [NES Flashcarts](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/nintendo-entertainment-system-flashcarts) for more.

## Background

The Famicom Disk System was an add-on to the Japanese-only Famicom. It allowed for re-writeable media called "Disk Cards" instead of cartridges, larger capacity and save-able games for all titles, and other enhanced features, such as improved soundtracks. While much cheaper to reproduce copies of games, it never propagated worldwide due to rapidly improving cartridge technologies happening concurrently.
