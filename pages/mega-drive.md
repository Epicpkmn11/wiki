This is the only one, boys.


ยน - Notes:

* Don't forget [NTSC vs PAL consideration](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/ntsc-vs-pal-flashcart-considerations) still apply.
* 32X games can be played off the cart *with* the 32X add-on attached and part of your tower-of-power. Despite this, the six (6) 32X-CD games cannot.
* Sega Master System game (and by extension, Game Gear and SG-1000?) can be run off of this Flashcart.
* Some NTSC Nintendo Entertainment System games can be emulated.
* MSU Mega Drive/Genesis games are a thing. And this is the only flashcart that can play them.
