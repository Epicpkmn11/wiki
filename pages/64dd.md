# Nintendo⁶⁴ Dynamic Disk Flashcarts

Perhaps unsurprisingly, like most other console add-ons, Nintendo⁶⁴ Dynamic Disk flashcarts do not exist. But again, not all hope is lost for these ~10(-ish) titles. Unlike options for the [Atari Jaguar CD](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/atari-jaguar-cd-flashcarts) and [Sega CD/Mega-CD](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/mega-drive-sega-cd-flashcarts), instead of these dumps running on flashcarts that added support, simply modifying your dumps from disk-based into cartridge-based formats will grant compatibility.


From there, any [Everdrive 64](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashcarts/wiki/nintendo-64-flashcarts) flashcart with support for v3 Firmware or later will play your converted dump.
