# Nintendo⁶⁴ Dynamic Disk Flashcarts

Perhaps unsurprisingly, like most other console add-ons, Nintendo⁶⁴ Dynamic Disk flashcarts do not exist. But again, not all hope is lost for these ~10(-ish) titles. Unlike options for the [Atari Jaguar CD](atari-jaguar-cd) and [Sega CD/Mega-CD](mega-drive), instead of these dumps running on flashcarts that added support, simply modifying your dumps from disk-based into cartridge-based formats will grant compatibility.

From there, any Everdrive 64 flashcart with support for v3 Firmware or later will play your converted dump.
