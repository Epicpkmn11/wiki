The timebomb is purely software, so switching to an alternative kernel will remove it. These carts are compatible with all DS, DSi, and 3DS consoles - even on the latest firmware - so they make a decent choice for unhacked DSi/3DS users, but the above <a href="#ace3ds+">Ace3DS+ clones</a> are recommended instead if possible. <br /><br /> Most of these carts sold today are labelled as r4isdhc<strong>.com</strong> or r4i-sdhc.<strong>com</strong>, but others do exist. The timebomb causes the cart to stop loading into the menu after a certain date, but can be fixed by either switching to the YSMenu kernel or the de-timebombed stock kernel. Ace3DS+ clones are recommended instead due to the Wood kernel having higher compatibility with certain features such as Wii connectivity in DS games. <br /><br /> One notable advantage of these carts over DSOne or Ace3DS+ clones is that they support ntrboot for installing CFW on a 3DS. If you are looking for a cart with ntrboot support, then these carts are a decent choice. However, the Ace3DS X above is preferable for that purpose, since it has ntrboot preflashed and uses a better kernel when in DS mode.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Obtaining and Setup</td> <td>This is only recommended <strong>if you cannot buy an Ace3DS X or Ace3DS+ clone</strong>.

Because of this the <a href="#ace3ds+">Ace3DS+ clones</a> are recommended if you choose to buy a flashcart for use on a DSi, as they are supported all the way up to the latest firmware version.</p> <p>If you boot an unsupported flashcart on a stock DSi, it will show black screens with white text that says “<a href="https://i.imgur.com/gE47UKA.png">An error has occurred</a>”. This can be bypassed by installing CFW on your DSi. Specifically, Unlaunch is required - with it, you will be able to load the flashcart from the DSi Menu if it was installed with launcher patches enabled or from Unlaunch itself, TWiLight Menu++, or hiyaCFW regardless whether or not Unlaunch’s launcher patches are enabled.</p> <p>On a hacked DSi, there is also the option to play DS games using nds-bootstrap (via <a href="https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/">TWiLight Menu++</a>). This allows games to be loaded from the DSi’s SD card without needing to purchase anything besides an SD card if you don’t already have one. However, nds-bootstrap’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRTkXOUXraTMjg1eedz_f7b5jiuyMv2x6e_jY_nyHSc/htmlview">compatibility</a> isn’t quite as good as that of flashcarts so buying a flashcart can still be worthwhile if you run into incompatible games. It is generally recommended to try the CFW route first, and only buy a flashcart if you want to play a game that isn’t compatible, or want the portability of a flashcart - being able to share the same save files by simply moving the flashcart over to another DS console.</p> <p>See <a href="https://dsi.cfw.guide">dsi.cfw.guide</a> for a guide on how to install CFW on your DSi.</p> <h3 id="3ds"> 3DS <a href="#3ds" class="header-anchor"><small>#</small></a> </h3> <p>On the 3DS family of consoles (including the 2DS and XL variants) there is a distinction between flashcarts that play 3DS games and flashcarts that play DS games. Flashcarts that play 3DS games are rendered mostly useless by the existence of CFW, which has <em>better</em> compatibility and is completely free, while 3DS flashcarts are very expensive. CFW also has other benefits over 3DS flashcarts such as the ability to run homebrew and emulators.</p> <p>Flashcarts for playing DS games on the other hand can still be useful, and everything in the <a href="#dsi">DSi</a> section above applies to DS mode flashcarts on the 3DS as well. That is, <a href="https://wiki.ds-homebrew.com/twilightmenu/installing-3ds.html">TWiLight Menu++</a> being a good option, but flashcarts for DS games having slightly higher compatibility. The <a href="#ace3ds-x">Ace3DS X</a> carts are the recommended DS flashcart for 3DS users as they support the latest 3DS firmware without needing CFW, and provide ntrboot in the case you may need it. Any DS flashcart can be run with CFW, either from the 3DS HOME Menu or TWiLight Menu++. Thus for CFW users, <a href="#dsone">DSOne SDHC</a> is also a great option.</p> <p>See <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide">3ds.hacks.guide</a> for how to install CFW on your 3DS.</p> <hr /> <h4 id="disclaimer"> Disclaimer <a href="#disclaimer" class="header-anchor"><small>#</small></a> </h4> <p>The information contained in this post is based on discussions, pages and forums around the web. flashcarts.net, its members, moderators, and contributors do not claim to own any or all of these flashcarts; nor vouch they will never harm your system; nor guarantee any suggested price; nor warrant completeness of lists at any given point, nor speak on behalf-of any retailers, seller or vendor.
